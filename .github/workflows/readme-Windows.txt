To install the VST3 plugins, copy the .vst3 _directories_ to:
C:/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/

To install the CLAP plugins, copy the .clap files to:
C:/Program Files/Common Files/CLAP/

You will need to create these directories yourself it they do not yet exist.

See https://github.com/free-audio/clap#hosts for instructions on how to enable
CLAP support in your DAW.
